## A Pelican Theme
### About
This is a theme for [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) inspired by the [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color scheme.

It is currently a work in progress. The theme itself is intended for long-form, text-heavy content, with only a few categories at once.

Targeted features are:
* Dark mode only
* Lightweight
* Pleasant reading experience

### TODO
1. Make sure standard templates are all covered and work (so far, only the basics have been tested)
2. Provide a screenshot
